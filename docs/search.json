These are only a few of our favorite songs and I hope you enjoy them as much as we do, so you wont go to the concert thinking “who’s this guy”?\nIf you’re more interested in his career, you can reed this article in Wikipedia about his work, or this resume in ALLMUSIC, hell, if you are really interested you can even read his autobiography."

    "text": "3. The Talking Heads - [Nothing but] flowers\nThis is my absolute favorite of that era. Right after the split with The Smiths, Marr was invited to collaborate with The Talking Heads, another mythic group in their last studio album: “Naked”, which is a little bit weird but I like it. Marr’s post-The Smith’s sound is all over this song, and his contribution is so unique that when you hear more recent versions of this song from David Byrne (former The Talking Heads singer), its just not the same. Note: If you’re from the Plant Sciences department, you will love this song as well."

Matt Jhonson (The The’s singer, songwriter, leader, and basically everything) and Marr met even before The smiths era, and according to Marr’s autobiography, they made a deal in colaborating in some albums. And from that collaboration appeared two albums: Mind Bomb (1989, which is an absolutely fucking mind bomb) and Dusk (1992). It is very difficult to select a representative song out of this collaboration, but I think this one might do. If you have time, I recommend both albums."

    "text": "Why corn?\nMaize, or more commonly know as corn, is one of the most important crops in the world. According to FAOSTAT, in 2020, around 202 million hectares were planted with this crop around the world, producing approximately 1.1 billion of tons of this basic grain, a 52% and 53% more than rice and wheat respectively! So we can see the importance of maize for feeding the whole world.\nBecause of its practical easy of pollination, large chromosomes, agronomic importance, large genetic diversity and the relevance of it’s wild relatives, the teosintes, maize became a model organism to perform a wide range of investigations, including themes such as plant domestication, genome evolution, developmental physiology, epigenetics, pest resistance, heterosis, quantitative inheritance, and comparative genomics.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20147033/ https://elifesciences.org/articles/05861\nAnother thing about corn is that you can eat your mistakes in the field! hahaha.\n\n\nWhat is a genetic architecture?\nWhen we start learning about genes in middle school, we always start with the work of Gregory Mendel on inheritance. By using peas (Pisum sativum) as his model organism, he perform crosses between different parental plants and studied the segregation of certain characteristics, like the color and shape of the peas in the offspring. From his observations, he was able to formulate the Laws of Heredity, that we tend to forget until we have to revisit his work in college or grad school.\nThese characteristics, or observable traits in an individual are called phenotypes. The phenotypes are determined by its genetic architecture, environmental factors and an interaction between these two. The genetic architecture is the underlying genetic basis of a phenotype and depends on several factors, mainly in the number of genes affecting such phenotype, the different versions of that gene present in a population, the size of the gene effects and the interactions with each other and with the environment.\nThe genetic architecture of different phenotype can be massively different between them. Qualitative phenotypes, for instance, can be classified in discrete classes; they tend to have simple inheritance patterns and simple genetic architectures, with just a couple of genes with big effect acting on them. Such is the case of the color of Mendel’s peas: the difference in green and yellow color is governed by a single gene, sgr. Quantitative traits, in the other hand, cannot be classified into discrete categories, and most of the time can take continuous values that can be described by a standard distribution. They tend to have complex genetic architectures, with hundreds or thousands of genes with medium and small acting on the phenotype. It might be worth to mention that several agronomic relevant phenotypes such as cold tolerance, nitrogen use efficiency, drought tolerance, phosphorus acquisition strategies, yield, flowering time and plant height are quantitative phenotyes.\nUnraveling the genetic architecture of quantitative traits requires the use of genetic and genomic tools, bioinformatic pipelines, statistical models, machine learning, field work mangement experience and many other interdisciplinary tools and skills that makes it a challenging but fun research topic.\nThus far in my career as a developing scientist, I’ve been working in two main research topics: Unraveling the genetic architecture of local adaptation of maize landraces to the Mexican Highlands, and the genetic architecture of host response to arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization.\nI bet that when you think about corn, you picture a yellow slob with a lot of kernels, grown in an endless field in the Midwest of the US; but let me tell you something, corn is more cool than that."

    "text": "I bet that when you think about corn, you always have in mind a yellow cob harvested from an endless corn field in some part of the Midwest of the USA, but you know? Corn is cooler than that. There are certain varieties, called landraces, that are locally grown in remarkably diverse environments by local people. These environments can range from cold and dry, to humid and hot, with good and bad soil, lots of rain or no rain at all, and yet, corn can grow and be productive in all of this diverse environments. With my research I try to understand how the landraces can adapt to different environmental conditions and use this knowledge to breed corn that can be more resilient in face of an unpredictable changing environment.\nIn more technical terms, for my research I use a set of genetic, genomic, statistic and bioinformatic tools to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation in maize.\nLandraces are dynamic populations, each with a unique identity shaped by biotic and abiotic stresses, crop management, seed handling, and consumer preferences. The sustained association of a given landrace population with a given locality results in local adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 59 native landraces of maize in México, center of origin and domestication of this amazing crop. This image shows a scoop of the variery of shapes, color, size, shape and uses that maize can have. Obtained from https://www.biodiversidad.gob.mx/diversidad/alimentos/maices/razas-de-maiz\n\n\nLocal adaptation is defined formally as superior performance of local varieties in their native environment vs nonlocal varieties. In the same way it is seen in wild populations, it is demonstrable by reciprocal transplantation experiments.\nLocal adaptation can be described in the context of genotype × environment interaction (GEI), i.e. the degree to which the relative performance of a given variety compared with others depends on environmental conditions."
